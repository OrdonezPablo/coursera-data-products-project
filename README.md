# Coursera Data Products Project: Global Equity Market Valuations with the Price/Earnings Ratio

This is my submission for Coursera's Developing Data Products final project within the Data Science Specialization.
The shiny app for this project is an application to finance, measuring and illustrating global equity market valuations throught the price-earnings-multiple. The first tab of the app shows a global overview of equity market valuations using the leaflet libray, which was part of the course. The second tab shows each market p/e time series detail by country.
